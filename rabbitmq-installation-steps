Queues:
    Types of queues: Persistent and Non persistent queues.(Cleared on restart).

Messages:
    Types of queues: Persistent and Non persistent queues.(Cleared on restart).


Exchanges:
    Forwards/Pushes messages to queues.

    Types of Exchanges
    ------------------
    - Fanout - Fanout out exchange routes all messages bound to it regardless of routing key.
    - Direct - Direct exchange routes messages to queues bound to the exchange based on routing key.
    - Topic - Most versatile routing capabilities which support namespace key routing and regex routing
        to one or more queues based on the routing key.
        1. (#) - 0 or more words
        2. (*) - matches any word in a specific section.
           multi.word.test
            - Matches
                'multi.#', '*.word.*', 'multi.word.test', '#'
           - Non matches
                'multi.*', 'single.#', 'multi.foo.test'
    - Headers - Uses the message headers to match to specified header of the bind queues.


Plugins
    consistent-hash-exchange-plugin: Ensure messages are evenly routed to queues bond to it. It evenly
    distributes based on the hash of the routing keys.

    To enable the plugin run.
    - rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_consistent_hash_exchange

    shovel-plugin: Reliably move messages from one source in one broker to a destination which could be
    in another broker. If the source and destination are in the same broker a shovel can be used to move
    messages between virtual hosts.

    Advantages:
        - Allow lose coupling as you could have different users on the source and destination brokers.
        - Some cases different versions on rabbitmq and erlang.
        - They are also WAN friendly no restrictions to LAN.
        - They are also customizable and can be configured as static shovels or dynamically at runtime.

     To enable the plugin run.
     - rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_shovel
     - rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_shovel_management
